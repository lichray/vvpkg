Vvpkg
=========

Vvpkg is a binary file version control library in C++14.  Vvpkg can
efficiently represent and maintain multiple binary files as
**revisions** to one conceptual file.  If you want to package
versionized data of arbitrary content types and sharing common parts
in unspecific order, this project is what you are looking for.
